# Bedrock Breaker Data Pack
Makes it so TNT destroys blocks of bedrock that are directly next to it on all 6 sides.

# How to Install
Download the data pack and either drag and drop into the data pack selection screen or drop into your save's datapacks folder than reload it.

# How to use
Light a TNT block as usual such that one of its faces is against a bedrock block, and the bedrock block will be destroied. It will not be dropped, only set to air.
If the tnt is touching water at all, it will not break the bedrock.
